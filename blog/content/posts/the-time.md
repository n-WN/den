Music like time travel takes me into the past or future,
waste too.
What is waste? It's some blurred concept.
Maybe I want to get something but I don't work for that,
is this a kind of waste?
Gradually, I compromise â€” compromise to life, to what I need,
to what I want, and to everything I think in the past.

Now I only follow what I could get instead of what I want to.
What's the meaning of my thinking? Is this a kind of waste? Sometimes,
I remind myself that I can't waste too much time, it will kill my life.
After these things, I enjoy wasting time, I call that enjoy the time, and enjoy life, if something I did and get happy, why not?

First, I wanted to make a lot of money, and then, I lost everything. (same that I got the 'everything')
